### Color Scheme

[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) has been used to apply color to the terminal text. This in order to make the program more intuitive and easier to read. 

Here are the colors being used:

### Data Model



### Flowchart

The following flowchart was designed using []() in order to plan the logic to be implemented in the program.

![Larrys LogBook Flowchart]()

As shown in the flowchart, the original order of some functions has been changed during the development process in to follow a more intuitive logic and sequence of events but the main idea behind the process is still the same.
